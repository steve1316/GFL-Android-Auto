# v1.0.0

This is the initial release of v1.0.0. What this rudimentary and "dumb" bot can do currently is run the maps listed in the Features section of the README, dismantle T-Dolls to make room, repair echelons, repeat logistics, corpse dragging and swapping, and various adjustable settings to change the behavior of the bot.

What the bot cannot do for now is run Event maps and use excess T-Dolls to enhance.
